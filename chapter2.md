Mechanics of Futures Markets
============================

> A trader who agreed to buy has a **long futures position** in one contract

> A trader who agreed to sell has a **short futures position** in one contract

> The price agreed to is the current **futures price**

Closing Out Positions
---------------------
Most of the traders choose to close out their positions prior to the delivery period specified in the contract. Closing out a position means entering into the **opposite trade to the original one**.

For example, the New York investor who bought a July corn futures contract on March 5 can close out the position by selling (i.e., shorting) one July corn futures contract on, say, April 20. The Kansas investor who sold (i.e., shorted) a July contract on March 5 can close out the position by buying one July contract on, say, May 25. In each case, the investor’s total gain or loss is determined by the change in the futures price between March 5 and the day when the contract is closed out.

Specification of a Futures Contract
-----------------------------------
The exchange must specify:

 - Asset
 - Contract size
 - Delivery arrangements
 - Delivery months
 - Price quotes
 - Price limits and position limits

As a general rule, it is the party with the *short position* that chooses what will happen when alternatives are specified by the exchange. When the party with the *short position* is ready to deliver, it files a *notice of intention to deliver* with the exchange.

Convergence of Futures Price to Spot Price
------------------------------------------










For example, the New York investor who bought a July corn futures contract on March 5 can close out the position by selling (i.e., shorting) one July corn futures contract on, say, April 20. The Kansas investor who sold (i.e., shorted) a July contract on March 5 can close out the position by buying one July contract on, say, May 25. In each case, the investor’s total gain or loss is determined by the change in the futures price between March 5 and the day when the contract is closed out.
