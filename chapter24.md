# Chapter 24 - Credit Derivatives

Credit Default Swaps
====================

It is a contract that provides insurance against the risk of a default by particular company. The company is known as the **reference entity** and a default by the company is known as a **credit event**.

The buyer of the insurance obtains the right to sell bonds issued by the company for their face value when a credit event occurs and the seller of the insurance agrees to buy the bonds for their face value when a credit event occurs.

The buyer of the CDS makes periodic payments to the seller until the end of the life of the CDS or until a credit event occurs.

The total amount paid per year, as a percent of the notional principal, to buy protection is known as the **CDS spread**.

CDS bond basis = CDS spread - Asset swap spread


Total Return Swaps
==================

A total return swap is a type of credit derivative. It is an agreement to exchange the total return on a bond for LIBRO plus a spread. The total return includes coupons, interest, and the gain or loss on the asset over the life of the swap.


Collateral Debt Obligations
===========================

Synthetic CDO
-------------
When a CDO is created from a bond portfolio, the resulting structure is known as a cash CDO. 

The originator of a synthetic CDO chooses a portfolio of companies and a maturity for the structure. It sells CDO protection on each company in the portfolio with the CDS maturities equaling the maturity of the structure. The synthetic CDO principal is the total of the notional principals underlying the CDSs. The originator has cash inflows equal to the CDS spreads and cash outflows when companies in the portfolio default. Tranches are formed and the cash inflows and outflows are distributed to tranches.
