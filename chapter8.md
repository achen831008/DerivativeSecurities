# Chapter 8 - Securitization and the Credit Crisis of 2007


Securitization
==============

MBS investors do face uncertainty about mortgage prepayments. Prepayments tend to be greatest when interest rates are low and the reinvestment opportunities open to investors are not particularly attractive. 

ABS
---
A simple securitization arrangement of the type used during the 2000 to 2007 period. This is known as an asset-backed security. A portfolio of income-producing assets such as loans is sold by the originating banks to a special purpose vehicle and the cash flows from the assets are then allocated to tranches (Senior, mezzanine, and equity). 

The return of Equity tranche is the highest as it is the most risky tranche (payments of interest and principal are not guaranteed). The equity tranche is more likely to lose part of its principal, and less likely to receive the promised interest payments on its outstanding principal.

Cash flows are allocated to tranches as a waterfall. Principal repayments are allocated to the senior tranche until its principal has been fully repaid. They are then allocated to the mezzanine tranche. Only after this has happened do principal repayments go to the equity tranche. Interest payments are allocated to the senior tranche until the senior tranche has received its promised return on its outstanding principal. Assuming that this promised return can be made, interest payments are then allocated to the mezzanine tranche and then to the equity tranche.

ABS CDO
-------
Finding investors to buy the senior tranches of ABS was not difficult because the tranches promised returns which were very attractive. Finding investors for mezzanine tranches was more difficult. This led to the creation of ABS of ABS. Many different mezzanine tranches are put in a portfolio and the risks associated with the cash flows from the portfolio are tranched out in the same way as the risks associated with the cash flows from the assets. The resulting structure is known as an ABS CDO. 

Subprime Mortgage Securitization
--------------------------------
Subprime mortgages were frequently securitized. The investors in tranches created from the subprime mortgages usually had no guarantees that interest and principal would be paid. Securitization played a part in the crisis. The behavior of mortgage originators was influenced by their knowledge that mortgages would be securitized. 

The Credit Crisis
-----------------
The capital of banks had been badly eroded by their losses. They had become much more risk-averse and were reluctant to lend. Creditworthy individuals and corporations found borrowing difficult. Credit spreads had increased dramatically. The world experienced its worst recession in several generations.
