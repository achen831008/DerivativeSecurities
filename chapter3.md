# Chapter 3 - Hedging Strategies Using Futures

> A **perfect hedge** is one that completely eliminates the risk.

Basic Principles
================

When an individual or company chooses to use futures markets to hedge a risk, the objective is usually to take a position that **neutralizes the risk** as far as possible.

> A short hedge is a hedge that involves a short position in futures contracts. 

> A long hedge is a hedge that involves a long position in futures contracts.


Basis Risk
==========

Uncertainty of Hedging:

 1. The asset whose price is to be hedged may not be exactly the same as the asset underlying the futures contract.
 2. The hedger may be uncertain as to the exact date when the asset will be bought
or sold.
 3. The hedge may require the futures contract to be closed out before its delivery month. 

These problems give rise to what is termed **basis risk**.

The Basis
---------

    Basis = Spot price of asset to be hedged - Futures price of contract used

To examine the nature of basis risk, we will use the following notation:

 - S1: Spot price at time t1
 - S2: Spot price at time t2
 - F1: Futures price at time t1
 - F2: Futures price at time t2
 - b1: Basis at time t1
 - b2: Basis at time t2

From the definition of the basis, we have

    b1 = S1 - F1 and b2 = S2 - F2

**Note:** basis risk can lead to an improvement or a worsening of a hedger’s position. 

Consider a **short** hedge. If the basis **strengthens** (i.e., increases) unexpectedly, the hedger’s position **improves**; if the basis **weakens** (i.e., decreases) unexpectedly, the hedger’s position **worsens**.

By hedging, a company ensures that the price that will be paid (or received) for the asset is

    S2 + F1 - F2

Choice of Contract
------------------
One key factor affecting basis risk is the choice of the futures contract to be used for hedging. This choice has two components:
1. The choice of the **asset underlying** the futures contract 
2. The choice of the **delivery month**.

In general, basis risk **increases** as the time difference between the hedge expiration and the delivery month **increases**. A good rule of thumb is therefore to choose a delivery month that is **as close as possible** to, but **later** than, the **expiration of the hedge**.
